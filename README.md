Introduction
------------

This codelab provides a deeper dive into Flutter than [Write Your First Flutter App, part 1](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1) and [part 2](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2). If you want a gentler introduction to Flutter, start with those.

What I learned

- How to write a Flutter app that looks natural on both Android and iOS
- How to use the Android Studio IDE, using many shortcuts supported by the Flutter plugin for Android Studio and IntelliJ
- How to debug your Flutter app
- How to run your Flutter app on an emulator, a simulator, and a device
